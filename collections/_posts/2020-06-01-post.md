No doubt that there are tons of data in the modern Internet sea for us to digest and then use.<br>

However, the information wanna know is just little of that which usually are separated in different websites,<br>

also most of the cases we just wanna fetch the focused points but not big piece of useless voice.<br>

For this trouble which everyone faced, now have the opensource webtool to rescue us from that blackhole.<br>

[Huginn][huginn-main] uses [IFTTT][ifttt-wiki] rule *(If This Then That)* to handle the Internet, that means a set of the recipes are made,<br>

if "birds" listen the sounds desired from the targeted place, it will take in action and then give results to home.<br>

The chains of recipes can complete the set of bothersome missions on the Internet, lighter and easier.<br>

The items of status bar have the relationship between each other in Huginn, there are the explanations:<br>

* **Agents**: Different type of "messenger birds" carry on different assigned tasks
* **Scenarios**: Group of agents linking produce a service scenairo
* **Events**: The data agent returned after a task, for the next agent in a scenairo
* **Credentials**: The secret values stored for agents accessing outside web service
* **Services**: External services agents called, needed to setup before used

That's the idea of this surprisingly webtool, after that we are able to fly on the Internet.

For the details and problems, its [wiki][huginn-wiki] always gives the answer!
