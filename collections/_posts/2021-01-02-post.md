## Brief

![reactive-programming-book](/assets/posts/2021-01-02/reactive-programming-book.jpg)

In computer programming, handling async events is never considered as a piece of cake to eat.

Although there are many approaches during the software history, but not doubt they are all complicated.

To develop and maintain this kind of applications always brain challenge to IT professionals all over the world.

Do we possible to write the codes more understandable and simpler? It can help operation as well.

Today IT bosses like Microsoft, Google and Redhat are preferred using Reactive programming as an approach.

This way particularly fits to frontend event UI and API response, so support multi-platform other than JavaScript.

But to be honest it is a breakthrough in programming, that many brand new concepts required to get familiar.

Until now, even I studied this a year before from Angular by Google and still feel hard to make these out.

But surely it is worthwhile for getting this new async model standard, to tidy up messy data flows in a level.

The followings are the summary from Internet to share that I think comprehensible to read or study.
