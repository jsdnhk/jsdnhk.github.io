### History

In the early software development, traditional waterfall model had been widely used for a long time.<br>

From the experience, waterfall model may not help when the features need to be delivered in short.<br>

As a result, agile development models are defined, the related tools and methods are made as well.<br>

[DevOps][amazon-devops], is then grown up, leads closer collaboration between Development and Operation teams.<br>

The culture or target, DevOps helps:

* Reduce the overhead on both Dev and Ops teams
* Speed up the software delivery time
* Better the service and value in business

Developers can use related tools or methods of DevOps CI to simplify and automate the workflow.<br>

However, how the operators handles the problems from DevOps generated?<br>

In Google, there is a team called "[Site Reliability Engineering][google-sre]" which implements DevOps in Operation.<br>

### SRE overview

Historically, the sysadmins in Operation are keeping the services work properly.<br>

However, when huge amount of servers needed to monitor and maintain, old way becomes clumsy.<br>

Thanks to Infrastructure as Code of DevOps, treating operations as software becomes possible.<br>

The target of SRE is to ensure the service-level agreement at high avalibility by automation.<br>

The missions of SRE can be divided to three sections with priority.

1. **Operation Automation**: Develop automation tasks, leverage different DevOps tools

2. **System Administration**: Allocate IT resources, maintain the services, handle changes

3. **Emergency Response**: Monitor the services with logs, troubleshoot the issue
