Following that will briefly describe [Rake][ruby-rake] with [Ruby][ruby] via [5W1H][5w1h] method.

## 1) What is Rake?

## 2) Why choose Rake? 

* provides one neat and tidy place for all software management tasks for a project

* allows to run tasks in parallel by built-in multitask methods

## 3) Who are Rake's target?

* need to centralize and manipulate the tasks in the server by one console

* need to automate numbers of boring, repetitive computer tasks in a clear and elegant way

## 5) Where use Rake?

* Package the binary

* Run various of tests or checking

* Build and deploy the project to production

  ... and more tasks wanna to execute

## 6) How to get start to use Rake? 

To use Rake you have to install Ruby in the host first, there are many ways to install Ruby but the best is using [RVM][ruby-rvm],<br>

a command-line tool which manage multiple ruby versions with own sets of gems that useful for Ruby development.<br>

As Rake is default installed in Ruby since version 1.9, such that can call command rake directly.<br>

To use rake, you need to have Rake file, there are four variants of its name which can use either one.

* rakefile
* Rakefile
* rakefile.rb
* Rakefile.rb

Let's define a default rake test and try to call, create a file `Rakefile` in directory with content,<br>

```ruby
desc "Says 'Hello, Rake'"
task :default do
  puts 'Hello Rake'
end
```

Now can run rake with command,<br>

```shell
$ rake	# OR rake default
Hello, Rake
```

A simple Rakefile is created then can get started to work out your own set!
