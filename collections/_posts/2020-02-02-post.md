Today is my first post published from my own blog in this special day,<br>
**20200202** means the dayâ€™s date can be read the same way backward and forward, hope you all good luck as well!;-)<br>
After the days of the webblog development using Jekyll framework,<br>
I appeared that Jekyll not only provides a way to convert the content Markdown docs to public webpages,<br>
but also gives 'code by convention' by prefined structure to the users for rapid, simple usage and maintenance.<br>
And there are the remarked features of Jekyll would like to focus on and widely use in the later blog versions.

### Features remarked:

- [Configuration](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/)
- [Collections](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/)
- [Pagination](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/)
- [Plugins](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/)
- [Mount at GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages)
