### Background

After Microsoft told the world about the desire to Linux, Windows Powershell became shared to the world like Linux did,

also supported cross-platform since 2016, which is the task automation and configuration management framework, 

with unique command-line shell and scripting language. There are some classic shells still widely used in Linux.

Some of the Linux or open-source fans may laugh at what Windows try to compact with Linux and even MacOS.

However, [Powershell][ms-powershell] is further improvement version from history with modern IT view by many intelligent experts, 

actually for some admin tasks it always can give much sharper solutions than the old-school [UNIX shells][unix-shells].

### Design

From official, Windows PowerShell can execute four kinds of named commands:

- **cmdlets**:  <br>command-lets are .NET programs followed *Verb*-*Noun* naming pattern, receive/emit objects through pipeline
- **PowerShell scripts**: <br>chain of commands to execute which pipeline objects can be passed, secured by execution policy
- **PowerShell functions**: <br>a grouping of code that handle input and return output, advanced functions can create "*script cmdlets*"
- **Standalone executable programs**: <br>launches it in a separate process, as usual as the standard way

### Benefits

1. **Cross-platform**: <br>general set of commands which are fitted for both Windows, Linux, MacOS,  that one shell is needed to learn only
2. **Structured-object data**: <br>optimized for dealing with structured data (e.g. JSON, CSV, XML, etc.), REST APIs, and object models
3. **Humanized language**: <br>comprehensible cmdlets and syntax closed to human thinking and logic, powerful auto-completion with help

There is no doubt that the new Powershell is a time evolution shell interface for human to talk with computer.

However, it still needs time to develop and grow up to become an universal IT standard in real, it made a good start!

### Syntax
