    - It is easier to change the specification to fit the program than vice versa.
    - Fools ignore complexity. Pragmatists suffer it. Some can avoid it. Geniuses remove it.
    - A year spent in artificial intelligence is enough to make one believe in God.
    - Prolonged contact with the computer turns mathematicians into clerks and vice versa.
    - Don't have good ideas if you aren't willing to be responsible for them.
    - You think you know when you learn, are more sure when you can write, even more when you can teach, but certain when you can program.
